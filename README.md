Mod Pouches
=============

###Mod Pouches
Mod Pouches is a Minecraft mod that adds one item to the game, the Pouch.
The Pouch is an item capable of storing a double-chest worth of content. However, it can only store items from a single mod and its children mods (if enabled in the config file).

To assign a mod to a Pouch, simply place the Pouch item in the left side of an anvil, and any item or block from the mod you wish to assign. Along with 1 level of experience, and ta-da!
The item placed in the right slot will not be consumed.

You might notice that the pouch is, by default, gray. You can change that! Simply rename a Name Tag with a Hex Color Code, and place the Pouch on the left and the Name Tag on the right.
The output will be a pouch, with the color corresponding to the Hex Code provided by the Name Tag. Any item present in the Pouch before the coloring will be preserved.
